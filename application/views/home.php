Another summer day <br>
Has come and gone away <br>
In Paris and Rome <br>
But I wanna go home <br>
Mmmmmmmm <br>
<br><br>
May be surrounded by<br>
A million people I <br>
Still feel all alone <br>
I just wanna go home <br>
Oh, I miss you, you know <br>
<br><br>
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you <br>
Each one a line or two <br>
â€œI'm fine baby, how are you? <br>
Well I would send them but I know that it's just not enough <br>
My words were cold and flat <br>
And you deserve more than that <br>
<br><br>
Another aeroplane <br>
Another sunny place <br>
I'm lucky, I know <br>
But I wanna go home <br>
Mmmm, I've got to go home <br>
<br><br>
Let me go home <br>
I'm just too far from where you are <br>
I wanna come home<br>
<br><br>
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life <br>
It's like I just stepped outside <br>
When everything was going right <br>
And I know just why you could not <br>
Come along with me <br>
'Cause this was not your dream <br>
But you always believed in me <br>
<br><br>
Another winter day has come <br>
And gone away <br>
In even Paris and Rome <br>
And I wanna go home <br>
Let me go home <br>
<br><br>
And I'm surrounded by <br>
A million people I <br>
Still feel all alone <br>
Oh, let me go home <br>
Oh, I miss you, you know <br>
<br><br>
Let me go home <br>
I've had my run <br>
Baby, I'm done <br>
I gotta go home <br>
Let me go home <br>
It will all be all right <br>
I'll be home tonight <br>
I'm coming back home <br>
